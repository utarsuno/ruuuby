| 0x0 | `additive identity` | | "Let `N` be a set that is closed under the operation of addition, denoted `+`. An `additive identity` for `N` is any element `e` such that for element `n` in `N`, `e + n = n = n + e`; example: `n + 0 = n = 0 + n`" | ex: the number `0`, "but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined, such as in `groups` and `rings`" |
| 0x1 | `cardinal numbers` | `cardinals` | "a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the `cardinality (size)` of sets" | "`cardinality` of a finite set is a `natural number`" |
| 0x2 | `transfinite numbers` | | "numbers that are 'infinite' in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers, yet not necessarily `absolutely infinite`" | "include the `transfinite cardinals`, which are used to quantify the size of infinite sets, and the `transfinite ordinals`, which are used to provide an ordering of infinite sets" |
| 0x3 | `ordinal numbers` | `ordinal` | "is one generalization of the concept of a natural number that is used to describe a way to arrange a (possibly infinite) collection of objects in order, one after another" | |
| 0x4 | `urelement` | `ur-element`, `atoms`, `individuals` | "an object that is not a `set`, but that may be an `element` of a set" | |
| 0x5 | `0⁰` | | "a mathematical expression with no agreed-upon value. The most common possibilities are `1` or leaving the expression undefined, with justifications existing for each, depending on context" | `Ruuuby` will evaluate as: `0⁰ == 1` |

| 0x0 | "in the natural numbers `ℕ` and all of its supersets(`ℤ`, `ℚ`, `ℝ`, or `ℂ`), the `additive identity` is `0`. Thus for any one of these numbers `n`, `n + 0 = n = 0 + n`" | `5 + 0 = 5 = 0 + 5` |

### Properties of Exponents

 * `x³ = x ⋅ x ⋅ x`
 * `xᵃ⋅xᵇ = xᵃ⁺ᵇ`
 * TODO: remaining properties and add them as unit tests

#### TODOs
