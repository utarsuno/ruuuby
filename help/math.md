## Vocab

| #    | term | alt. name | definition | extra |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | `additive identity` | | "Let `N` be a set that is closed under the operation of addition, denoted `+`. An `additive identity` for `N` is any element `e` such that for element `n` in `N`, `e + n = n = n + e`; example: `n + 0 = n = 0 + n`" | ex: the number `0`, "but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined, such as in `groups` and `rings`" |
| 0x01 | `cardinal numbers` | `cardinals` | "a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the `cardinality (size)` of sets" | "`cardinality` of a finite set is a `natural number`" |
| 0x02 | `transfinite numbers` | | "numbers that are 'infinite' in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers, yet not necessarily `absolutely infinite`" | "include the `transfinite cardinals`, which are used to quantify the size of infinite sets, and the `transfinite ordinals`, which are used to provide an ordering of infinite sets" |
| 0x03 | `ordinal numbers` | `ordinal` | "is one generalization of the concept of a natural number that is used to describe a way to arrange a (possibly infinite) collection of objects in order, one after another" | |
| 0x04 | `urelement` | `ur-element`, `atoms`, `individuals` | "an object that is not a `set`, but that may be an `element` of a set" | |
| 0x05 | `0‚Å∞` | | "a mathematical expression with no agreed-upon value. The most common possibilities are `1` or leaving the expression undefined, with justifications existing for each, depending on context" | `Ruuuby` will evaluate as: `0‚Å∞ == 1` |
| 0x06 | `golden ratio` | `œÜ` | "two quantities are in the `golden ratio` if their `ratio` is the same as the `ratio of their sum` to the `larger of the two quantities` | `a+b` is to `a` as `a` is to `b` |
| 0x07 | `Euler-Mascheroni constant` | `Œ≥` |the `limiting` difference between the `harmonic series` and the `natural logarithm` | "a mathematical constant recurring in analysis and number theory` |
| 0x08 | `Ordinary Differential Equation` | | a `differential equation` involving only ordinary derivatives with respect to a single independent variable |
| 0x09 | `Partial Differential Equation` | | a `differential equation` involving partial derivatives with respect to more than one independent variable |
| 0x10 | `method of least squares` | | `TODO:` add notes with respect to `Œ±` and `Œ≤` for minimizing `S` (`partial derivatives` to be zero) |

| 0x0 | "in the natural numbers `‚Ñï` and all of its supersets(`‚Ñ§`, `‚Ñö`, `‚Ñù`, or `‚ÑÇ`), the `additive identity` is `0`. Thus for any one of these numbers `n`, `n + 0 = n = 0 + n`" | `5 + 0 = 5 = 0 + 5` |
| 0x6 | is solution to  `x¬≤ - x -1 = 0` which is `œÜ = (1 + ‚àö(5))/2` | |

### Properties of Exponents

 * `x·µÉ‚ãÖx·µá = x·µÉ‚Å∫·µá`
 * `x·µÉ/x·µá = x·µÉ‚Åª·µá`
 * `(x·µÉ)·µá = x·µÉ·µá`
 * `(x‚ãÖy)·µÉ = x·µÉ‚ãÖx·µá`
 * `(x/y)·µÉ = x·µÉ/y·µÉ`
