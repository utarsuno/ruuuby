### ‚Ñ§

 * single operation: `+` (`-` operation is just adding a negative integer)
 * `x + y -> an integer` "closed under addition"
 * `x / y -> not an integer` "not closed under division"

### Group

 * set of elements `G`
 * set of operations, ex: `+`, `*`
 * closer under operation `x, y ‚àà G -> x * y ‚àà G`
 * inverse `x‚Åª¬π` exists for all `x`
   * `x * x‚Åª¬π = e`
 * identity: `y * e = e * y = y`
 * associativity: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`
 * may not be `commutative`
 * if `G` is `commutative`, it's called `Abelian`/`Commutative` group
 * if `G` is not `commutative`, `noncommutative`/`non-abelian` group

### Ring

 * set of elements where you can `+`, `-`, `*`
   * may not have `division`
 * adding two elements in a ring will give another element from the ring
 * `*` may be `non-commutative`
 * multiplication is `associative`
 * `distributive property`: `a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c`
