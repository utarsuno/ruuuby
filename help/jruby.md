#### public abstract class DynamicMethod extends java.lang.Object
```
DynamicMethod represents a method handle in JRuby, to provide both entry points into AST and bytecode interpreters, but also to provide handles to JIT-compiled and hand-implemented Java methods.
All methods invokable from Ruby code are referenced by method handles, either directly or through delegation or callback mechanisms.
