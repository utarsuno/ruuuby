    #
    # terminology:
    #  - repository:
    #    * git mainly operates on the `.git` directory, not the entire filesystem
    #    * you can have a repo within a repo
    #  - commits:
    #    * snapshot composed of contents of all files as is
    #    * there is a custom space-efficient compression algorithm used by git (but otherwise this is cause of any size bloat from .git)
    #    * composed of: commit_message, author, parents(commit(s) that this commit points-to/follows), name(SHA of the commit-obj)
    #  - branches:
    #    * just a convention for a logical/linear trail of git-commits
    #  - tags:
    #    * similair to branches but they are a fixed pointer of a specific commit
    #
    # misc notes:
    #  - any two `disparate` commits chosen will have a common ancestor that can be found by traversing down both commit's pointer chains until reaching the common ancestor node
    #  - "git tree" mathematically is a DAG (`directed asyclic graph`), note: every `tree` is a DAG but vise-versa is not implied (@see https://dev.to/nichartley/whats-a-git-tree-5149)
